Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m^2 or greater. Obesity is a complex medical condition characterized by excess body fat that increases the risk of developing co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Excess weight is a global concern with an ever-growing prevalence.  The goal of this research study is to develop effective and practical post-surgical guidelines, based on clinical data, in order to determine potential predictors of surgical success.  With this information, clinicians and patients can work together to minimize long-term weight regain post-surgery. To achieve this goal, we applied various machine learning (ML) algorithms to model our dataset and provide a list of critical features to target in order to have more successful long-term weight loss outcomes.
